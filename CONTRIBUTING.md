First and foremost, welcome to the **Lawnchair Launcher** Contributing Guidelines! This document will contain everything you'll need to contribute to the **Lawnchair Launcher** project.

## üëã Before you start!

We would like you to be familiar with the tools we are using. The tool(s) you will be using depend on the type of contribution you are going to make.

### üåê Translation

For translation, you only need to know one tool, [Crowdin](https://lawnchair.crowdin.com), which allows us to collaborate with multiple translators & proofreaders.

Here are few tips for starters:

-   When using quotation marks, insert the symbols specific to the target language, as listed in this [this summary table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table);
-   Lawnchair uses title case for some English UI text while other languages do not use title case; opt for sentence case instead;
-   Some English terminology may have not have commonly-used equivalents in other languages. In such cases, use short descriptive phrases‚Äîfor example, the equivalent of _bottom row_ for _dock_;
-   Some languages (e.g. French) has variations of words depending if it's masculine or feminine (gender-specific); we recommend opting for gender-neutral words instead.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Code

For code, it's highly recommended that you use an IDE (e.g. [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)), know [Java](https://www.java.com) or preferably [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) which is a powerful source management control tool for collaborating with multiple programmers.

To clone the repository, you must clone the repository and its submodules using the recursive flag:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair.git
```

To build **Lawnchair Launcher**, select the `lawnWithQuickstepDebug` build type. Should you face errors relating to the `iconloaderlib` and `searchuilib` projects, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Here are some contribution tips to help you get started:

-   Always make sure that you're up-to-date with **Lawnchair Launcher** by setting your branch to `14-dev` or newer;
-   Make sure your code is logical and well-formatted. If using Kotlin, see [‚ÄúCoding conventions‚Äù in the Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html);
-   [The `lawnchair` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/14-dev/lawnchair) houses Lawnchair‚Äôs own code, whereas [the `src` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/14-dev/src) includes a clone of the Launcher3 codebase with modifications. Generally, place new files in the former, keeping changes to the latter to a minimum.

#### Versioning scheme

As of [#4361](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/pull/4361), the **Lawnchair Launcher** version code is separated by four sectors:

<p align="center">
    <img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/validcube/lawnchair/pave-path/.github/version.svg" width="100%">
</p>

1. Android's major version
2. Android's minor version
3. Lawnchair Launcher's development status
4. Lawnchair Launcher's development version

##### Android's major & minor versions

These makes up the first two sectors of the version code, Android 11 will be `11_00_XX_XX` while Android 12.1 will be `12_01_XX_XX`.

##### Development status & version

Depending on which status the **Lawnchair Launcher** is on, it will have an impact on the 3rd and 4th sectors of the version code. For example, alpha 4 for the **Lawnchair Launcher** will be `XX_XX_01_04`. 

Below is a table explaining the third field (release type):

| Status            | Stage    |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Alpha             | 01       |
| Beta              | 02       |
| Release Candidate | 03       |
| Release           | 04       |
