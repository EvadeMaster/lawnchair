# Lawnchair Visual Guidelines

This directory lists all the decoration & visual explainers used in the Lawnchair Documentation.

All assets created should use the color listed in [CSS](css/) and the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) ([OFL v1.1](https://github.com/rsms/inter/?tab=OFL-1.1-1-ov-file#readme)) typography.

When creating device mockups for Lawnchair, make sure that you're using the latest commits of Lawnchair or use Lawnchair Nightly as base.
